# Brainstorming Techniques Library

## Creative Expansion
1. What If Scenarios: Ask extreme hypotheticals (unlimited resources/opposite situations);wait for response→ask next hypothesis;best for: innovation breakthrough|energy: high|duration: 15-20min
2. Analogical Thinking: Give 1 analogy example;guide to find 2-3 similar cases;best for: cross-domain transfer|energy: moderate
3. Reversal/Inversion: Pose reverse question (how to make it worse?);guide exploration;best for: breaking stuck thinking|energy: high
4. First Principles Thinking: Ask "what are the certain facts?";guide breakdown to fundamental truths;best for: complex problems|energy: moderate
5. Forced Relationships: Connect two unrelated concepts;find bridges and connection points;best for: unexpected innovation|energy: high
6. Time Shifting: Ask "how would past/future solve this?";explore different era constraints and opportunities;best for: perspective shift|energy: moderate
7. Metaphor Mapping: Use extended metaphors as thinking tools;map problem elements;extract insights;best for: making abstract concrete|energy: moderate

## Structured Frameworks
8. SCAMPER Method: Ask systematically (Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put to use/Eliminate/Reverse);wait for response before next item;best for: product improvement|energy: moderate|duration: 20-30min
9. Six Thinking Hats: Switch perspectives sequentially (White-facts/Red-emotions/Yellow-benefits/Black-risks/Green-creativity/Blue-process);collect ideas at each hat;best for: comprehensive analysis|energy: moderate|duration: 30-40min
10. Mind Mapping: Establish central concept;guide branching divergence;build connections;best for: organizing complex thoughts|energy: moderate
11. Resource Constraints: Impose extreme limitations (only $1/no tech/1 hour);force priorities and creative efficiency;best for: lean innovation|energy: high

## Collaborative
12. "Yes, And" Building: They suggest idea→you "yes, and..."→iterate back and forth;create positive collaborative flow;best for: team-building|energy: high|duration: 15-20min
13. Brain Writing Round Robin: Silent idea writing→pass to next person→build on received ideas;maintain documentation and equal participation;best for: quiet voices|energy: moderate|duration: 20-25min
14. Random Stimulation: Throw random word/image as catalyst;force unexpected connections;best for: breaking mental blocks|energy: moderate
15. Role Playing: Generate solutions from different stakeholder perspectives;build empathy and comprehensive consideration;best for: multi-party balance|energy: moderate

## Deep Exploration
16. Five Whys: Ask "why"→wait for answer→continue asking "why" (5 times total);drill down to root causes;best for: root cause analysis|energy: moderate|duration: 10-15min
17. Morphological Analysis: List key parameters first;enumerate options for each;systematically explore combinations;best for: complex system solutions|energy: high
18. Provocation Technique (PO): Give deliberately provocative statement;extract useful ideas from absurdity;best for: breakthrough thinking|energy: high
19. Assumption Reversal: Identify core assumptions;flip assumptions;rebuild from new foundation;best for: paradigm shifts|energy: high
20. Question Storming: Generate only questions not answers;explore "what don't we know?";best for: defining problem space|energy: moderate

## Introspective Delight
21. Inner Child Conference: Guide "what would 7-year-old you ask/do?";rekindle pure curiosity and playfulness;best for: overcoming adult complications|energy: high
22. Shadow Work Mining: Explore "what are you avoiding? where's resistance?";uncover unconscious blocking patterns;best for: breaking psychological barriers|energy: moderate
23. Values Archaeology: Ask "what really matters here?";dig to bedrock motivations;clarify non-negotiables;best for: clarifying priorities|energy: moderate
24. Future Self Interview: Seek wisdom from 80-year-old self;gain long-term perspective;best for: major decisions|energy: low
25. Body Wisdom Dialogue: Focus on physical sensations and gut feelings;trust somatic intelligence;best for: when rational thinking is stuck|energy: low

## Theatrical
