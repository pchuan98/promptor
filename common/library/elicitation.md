# Elicitation Methods Library

## Analytical

1. Expand/Simplify: Ask if need "expand" or "simplify"→identify audience→adjust complexity;best for: content adaptation
2. Chain of Thought: Detail step-by-step reasoning→reveal assumptions→show decision points;best for: transparency
3. Critique & Optimize: Identify flaws from role expertise→suggest improvements;best for: quality enhancement
4. Flow & Alignment: Check logical progression→validate dependencies→assess goal contribution;best for: coherence validation
5. Boundary Exploration: Test extreme inputs/cross-boundary cases/edge users;best for: edge case coverage
6. Hypothesis-Experiment: Express as testable hypothesis→design minimal test→quantify metrics;best for: data-driven decisions

## Creative

7. Tree of Thoughts: Explore multiple paths→classify certainty→apply search algorithm;best for: complex problems
8. What-If Scenarios: Ask extreme hypotheticals(10x scale/zero cost/opposite)→explore possibilities;best for: innovation breakthrough
9. Timeline Projection: Review at 6mo/1yr/5yr→assess long-term impact→predict evolution;best for: future-proofing
10. Scale Transformation: Test at 10x/0.1x/zero-cost/infinite-resource→identify breaking points;best for: scalability
11. Cross-Domain Analogy: Apply biology/architecture/traffic patterns→borrow from other disciplines;best for: fresh perspectives
12. Creative Constraints: Apply tech/time/interface limits→force innovation;best for: resourceful solutions
13. Assumption Elimination: List assumptions→challenge each→explore when broken;best for: breakthrough thinking

## Collaborative

14. Perspective Rotation: Rotate stakeholder viewpoints(PO/Dev/QA/UX/Architect)→identify conflicts→synthesize;best for: holistic view
15. Red vs Blue Team: Red attacks→Blue defends→reveal blindspots;best for: robustness testing
16. Emotion & Sensory Map: Track emotional journey→identify pain/delight points→use sensory metaphors;best for: UX design
17. Inclusive & Ethics Review: Check accessibility/privacy/abuse scenarios/long-term impact;best for: responsible design

## Advanced

18. Risk & Premortem: Assume failure→list causes→identify edge cases→create prevention;best for: proactive mitigation
19. Critical Challenge: Play devil's advocate→apply YAGNI→highlight weaknesses;best for: stress testing
20. Self-Consistency: Generate multiple paths→compare→identify most reliable;best for: validation
21. Role-Pattern Hybrid: Combine role expertise with patterns(Architect+Risk/UX+Journey);best for: specialized analysis
22. Cognitive Bias Audit: Check confirmation/anchoring/groupthink biases→switch thinking modes;best for: bias awareness
23. Meta-Prompt Analysis: Analyze current approach→question methods→suggest alternative frameworks;best for: process optimization
